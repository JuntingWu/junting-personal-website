# This is my personal website! A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Getting Started Locally


First, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuntingWu/junting-personal-website
cd junting-personal-website
```
Then, run the website in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the results of changes!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
and uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

First lines of code were written on May 8, 2024.
